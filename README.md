# CROSSCUT

## [Description](http://marksteeregames.com/Crosscut_rules.pdf)

> Crosscut is a two-player game played on a square board, size
10x10 or smaller*, initially empty. Double sided discs, red on one side and blue on
the other, are used. The two players, Red and Blue, take turns placing their own
discs (discs showing their color) on the board, one disc per turn, starting with Red.
If you have a placement available, you must make one. If you don’t have a placement
available, your turn is skipped. Mark Steere designed Crosscut in June 2023.
